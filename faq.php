A few disreputable companies try to get customers to sign a contract where they only pass over a licence to use the software. The developer is then legally entitled to ask for further fees in the future, even though the customer has paid for the development.</p>

                                                <p class="mt-3">Vcreate Tech Global advises: Some developers try to reduce costs by building systems on top of third-party or in-house 'platforms'. The problem with such an approach is that it leads to problems with maintenance and licensing. The developer is unlikely to release source code to his wonderful platform, so if there is a serious problem it is difficult to get another company to take over. You should ensure that all source code to the whole system is available.</p>

                                                <p class="mt-3">Vcreate Tech Global advises: There are many powerful libraries available to developers, and these do save a lot of time. However, such libraries may be licensed to the developer, not to the end customer, and this either presents a future additional cost, or a maintenance issue. Similarly, the system may be designed to work with external systems like MS SQL Server, which have associated costs. The developer should make sure the customer understands all such costs.</p>

                                                <p class="mt-3">Vcreate Tech Global advises: When software is being written by a team, the team members need to share code between each other. A source-code control system makes this easy, and is a very standard tool. All professional developers should use source-code control. There is a possible argument that source code control is not required if the project only has one developer, but we would still recommend it be used, because it ensures that code is backed up to a central location. The source code should be backed up nightly to another location, otherwise there is always a risk that it might be lost.</p>

Whilst the best salesperson may be trained to do this, our experience is that using a person with development expertise makes this process more reliable and far quicker, because it eliminates communication errors.

The skills required to install a new system can involve multiple people within the IT department, e.g. one person to configure the firewall, another to work with the database. If the development company has in-house people to do this, it can save quite a lot of time.</p>

                                                <p class="mt-3">Vcreate Tech Global advises: Obviously, a company that has been in business longer is likely to be more stable than a new start-up. The first three years of any business are the toughest, so look more carefully at companies younger than this. However, there are disadvantages to older businesses, particularly in technology, as they might not be up to date.</p>

Development projects are often extended beyond their original deadline, and with a smaller company this can often mean that new projects cannot start on time. A smaller firm will also have less people to draw on to solve technical problems.</p>

However, Visual Basic 6 is no longer supported by Microsoft, and absolutely should not be used for new projects. Microsoft Access is very popular for workgroup systems, and is effective at this level, but it is not suited for larger projects. Code Gear's Delphi - which was Borland Delphi - is a very strong tool, but it's difficult to find people to update the code.</p>

Programmers have very powerful tools to help remove bugs, but these tools generally only work on the programmers own computer. This is unfortunately no help in solving bugs that happen on the customers' computer. The best solution to this problem is to add code to the software so that it writes detailed logs on exactly what happens. When a problem occurs at the customers' site, the program should send the log to the development team, who can then fix it. Unfortunately, writing logs takes extra effort, and many programmers don't do this routinely.</p>
